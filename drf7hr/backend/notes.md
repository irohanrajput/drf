** serializers
1. While defining a serializer class, we essentially define a blueprint for how to serialize and deserialize instances of that particular model.

2. When we want to serialize a specific instance of that model, we create an instance of Serializer and pass the model instance as the instance parameter for serializing and deserializing.
